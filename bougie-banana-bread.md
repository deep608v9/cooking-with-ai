## Ingredients

### Main Ingredients
- 3 very ripe bananas (roasted if possible - see note)
- ½ cup (113g) unsalted butter
- ¾ cup (150g) brown sugar
- ¼ cup (50g) granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs, room temperature
- ¼ cup (60g) Greek yogurt (full-fat preferred)
- 2 tablespoons bourbon
- ½ cup (120ml) buttermilk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

### Dry Ingredients
- 1¾ cups (210g) all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon

### Optional Add-ins
- ½ cup (60g) chopped walnuts or pecans
- ½ cup (85g) chocolate chips

## Instructions

### 1. Prep
- Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C)
- Grease and line a 9×5-inch loaf pan with parchment paper
- Leave parchment overhang for easy removal

### 2. Brown the Butter
- In a small saucepan, melt butter over medium heat
- Continue cooking, swirling occasionally
- Cook until butter turns golden brown and smells nutty (about 5-7 minutes)
- Remove from heat and let cool slightly

### 3. Mix Wet Ingredients
- In a large bowl, mash bananas thoroughly
- Add browned butter and both sugars
- Whisk until combined
- Mix in eggs one at a time
- Stir in:
  - Greek yogurt
  - Bourbon
  - Buttermilk
  - Vanilla

### 4. Mix Dry Ingredients
- In a separate bowl, whisk together:
  - Flour
  - Baking soda
  - Baking powder
  - Salt
  - Cinnamon

### 5. Combine and Rest
- Gently fold dry ingredients into wet ingredients until just combined
- *Note: Some small lumps are okay - be careful not to overmix*
- If using nuts or chocolate chips:
  - Toss them with 1 tablespoon of flour first
  - Fold into the batter
- Allow batter to rest for 15 minutes
  - *This helps hydrate the flour and improves texture*

### 6. Bake
- Pour batter into prepared pan
- Bake for 55-65 minutes
- Done when toothpick inserted in center comes out with a few moist crumbs (not wet batter)

### 7. Cool
- Allow to cool in pan for 15 minutes
- Use parchment overhang to lift out
- Cool completely on wire rack before slicing

## Notes

### Roasted Bananas
For deeper flavor:
- Roast unpeeled bananas on a baking sheet at 300°F
- Roast for 15-20 minutes until skins are black
- Cool, peel, and mash

### Storage
- Improves after a day as flavors meld
- Room temperature: Up to 3 days (wrapped in parchment paper)
- Refrigerated: Up to a week
- Freezer: Up to 3 months
  - Wrap tightly in parchment and foil
