# Dan's AI Bread

## Ingredients

### Tangzhong
- 3 tablespoons bread flour
- ½ cup water

### Dough Enhancer
*Mix together in small bowl:*
- 1 tablespoon vital wheat gluten
- ⅛ teaspoon vitamin C powder
- 1 teaspoon sunflower lecithin powder

### Main Dough
- 3½ cups bread flour
- 1 cup warm water, plus 2-3 tablespoons extra
- 2¼ teaspoons active dry yeast
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1½ teaspoons salt

## Instructions

### 1. Make Tangzhong
- Whisk flour and water in small saucepan over medium heat
- Stir constantly until it becomes a thick paste (about 165°F or when lines hold in the mixture when stirred); it should look sort of like pudding
- Transfer to a bowl and let cool to room temperature (you can use the fridge to make it go faster)

### 2. Prepare Yeast
- Combine warm water (total amount), yeast, and sugar
- Let stand 5-10 minutes until foamy (if it doesn't foam/bubble, your yeast is dead ☹️)

### 3. Mix Ingredients
In stand mixer bowl:
- Combine flour and dough enhancer mixture
- Add cooled tangzhong
- Add yeast mixture
- Add remaining warm water
- Add olive oil

### 4. Mix and Knead
- Start with dough hook on low speed until combined
- Add salt
- Knead 7-8 minutes until smooth and elastic
- Dough should be slightly tacky but not sticky - add extra water if needed, 1 tablespoon at a time

### 5. First Rise
- Place in lightly oiled bowl (or leave in the mixer bowl if you are lazy)
- Cover with plastic wrap or damp towel
- Let rise 60-90 minutes until doubled
- Leaving the bowl inside the oven after pre-heating it up to 150-200 (and then turning it off), can produce an even better rise

### 6. Shape
- Divide into 2 equal pieces, or just make one big one, I'm a recipe not your mom
- Shape into round loaves
- Place on parchment-lined baking sheet
- Cover loosely
- Let rise 45-60 minutes

### 7. Prepare for Baking
- Preheat oven to 400°F
- Place empty metal pan on bottom rack
- (optional) Score top of loaves with X pattern

### 8. Bake
- Put bread in oven
- Pour 1 cup hot water into empty pan for steam
- Bake 25-30 minutes until golden brown
- Internal temperature should reach 190°F
- (optional) Brush with melted butter right after removing from oven

### 9. Cool (or eat it while its warm!)
- Remove from baking sheet
- Cool on wire rack
- Best with Kerrygold butter and a bit of flaky salt
