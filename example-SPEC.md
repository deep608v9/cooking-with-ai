# Cloudflare IP List Monitor

This Azure Function runs on a schedule and downloads the current Cloudflare Source IP List (https://www.cloudflare.com/ips-v4), stores the list in an Azure Storage Account, and sends a webhook alert if a new IP has been added.

Written in Python, using the requests library. Deployed with Terraform to Azure; a managed service identity is used for the Azure Function to Authenticate to the Azure Storage Account.
