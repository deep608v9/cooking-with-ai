## Method

### 1. Yeast Mixture – The Foundation of Soft Bread
- Use room temperature milk (225ml) - not too hot
- Add 30g sugar
- Sprinkle 1.5 tsp (4.5g) instant dry yeast, mix, and set aside
- *Note: If using active dry yeast, let it sit until foamy before use*

### 2. Dry Ingredients – Creating the Dough's Structure
- Sift 300g bread flour for a light, lump-free dough
- *Note: If using all-purpose flour, reduce liquid slightly*
- Add 5g (1 tsp) salt and mix well before adding wet ingredients

### 3. Mixing & Kneading – Bringing the Dough to Life
- Slowly mix the yeast mixture into the flour
- *Note: The dough will be sticky at first — trust the process!*
- Transfer to a lightly floured surface and start kneading
- By hand:
  - Knead 3-4 minutes
  - Then add 20g soft butter
- Using a mixer:
  - Start on low, then increase speed
- Knead for at least 15 minutes until the dough is soft, smooth, and elastic
- Perform the Windowpane Test—stretch the dough thin without tearing

### 4. Proofing – Let the Dough Rise!
- Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover, and let it rise for 1 hour
- *Cold kitchen tip: Keep it in a switched-off oven or microwave with a cup of hot water for humidity*

### 5. The Garlic Butter Mixture – Flavor Boost!
- Mix together:
  - 2 tbsp garlic paste
  - 50g soft butter
  - 1 tsp chili flakes
  - Chopped parsley
  - Salt
- *Note: Want fresh garlic paste? Cook garlic in oil until soft, then blend until smooth*

### 6. Shaping & Filling – The Fun Part!
- Punch down the dough to release air, then roll it evenly
- Spread garlic butter all over—no empty spots!
- Add cheese generously for a rich, gooey texture
- Cut into squares the size of your bread pan, stack, and arrange into pan (not too tight)

### 7. Second Proofing & Preheating
- Let dough rise for another hour for soft layers
- Preheat oven to 350°F
- Before baking, brush extra garlic butter on top

### 8. Baking – The Final Step!
- Bake for 30 minutes until golden brown and crispy
- Enjoy the rich aroma of garlic, butter, and melted cheese filling your kitchen!
