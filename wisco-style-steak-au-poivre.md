## Ingredients

### For the Steaks
- 2 New York strip steaks (1½"-thick, about 1½ lb. total)
- Kosher salt
- Freshly ground pepper
- 1 Tbsp. whole black peppercorns
- 2 Tbsp. Ghee or Avocado Oil

### Aromatics
- 4 garlic cloves
  - 2 smashed
  - 2 thinly sliced
- 3 sprigs thyme
- 1 large shallot, finely chopped

### For the Sauce
- 3 Tbsp. Kerrygold Butter
- ⅓ cup Korbel Brandy
- ½ cup heavy cream
- Flaky sea salt

## Instructions

### 1. Prepare the Steaks
- Pat steaks dry with paper towels
- Season all over with kosher salt and a generous amount of ground pepper
- Let sit 15–30 minutes (or better yet, overnight)

### 2. Prepare the Peppercorns
- Coarsely crush peppercorns using either:
  - Mortar and pestle, or
  - Place in resealable plastic bag and crush with a small saucepan
- *Note: They should be a lot coarser than ground pepper*

### 3. Sear the Steaks
- Heat oil in a large skillet (preferably cast iron) over medium-high
- Cook steaks, undisturbed, until deep golden brown crust forms underneath (about 3 minutes)
- Turn over and cook second side until golden brown (about 3 minutes)
- If steaks have a fat cap:
  - Stand them on their sides with tongs
  - Cook until browned (about 3 minutes)

### 4. Finish the Steaks
- Reduce heat to medium-low
- Add to pan:
  - Smashed garlic cloves
  - Thyme sprigs
  - 1 Tbsp. Kerrygold Butter
- Cook while basting steak with a spoon continuously
- Cook until internal temperature reaches 120°F (use a meat thermometer!)
- Transfer to cutting board
- Let rest 10 minutes

### 5. Make the Sauce Base
- Combine in skillet:
  - Shallot
  - Sliced garlic
  - Crushed peppercorns
  - Remaining 2 Tbsp. butter
- Cook, stirring often, until shallot and garlic are softened but not browned (about 5 minutes)

### 6. Finish the Sauce
- Remove from heat
- Add Korbel Brandy to pan
- Return to medium heat
- Cook until cognac is mostly evaporated and spoon leaves streaks in skillet (1-2 minutes)
- Add cream
- Bring to a simmer
- Cook until sauce coats spoon (about 1 minute)
- Season with kosher salt

### 7. Serve
- Slice steaks against the grain
- Transfer to platter
- Pour any juices from cutting board back into skillet and stir into sauce
- Spoon sauce generously over steak
- Sprinkle with flaky sea salt
- Enjoy with a Wisconsin-style Old Fashioned
